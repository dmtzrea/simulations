To use the results already saved in the folders, run lines 1-42, and then 89-172. 
This makes the quantile line plots (reported in the thesis).

For the bootstrap part of the analysis, run lines 175-240, and then 283 until the end of the 
script. This should avoid recomputing estimations which are already saved.

If you wish to recompute the estimates, run the code from start to finish without skipping lines.
The bootstrap code might take around 4 hours to finish.
